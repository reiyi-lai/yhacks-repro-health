# Workflow

1. To install the openAI python library, `pip install --upgrade openai`
2. Create a `.env` file with the single line `OPENAI_API_KEY=...`
3. In the terminal in the backend folder, do `export OPEN_API_KEY=...` and run it

4. When running imported functions using tokenizer, must first set `export TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=true`



Note: Python 3.10.7 was used
